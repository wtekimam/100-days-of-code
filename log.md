### Day 2: January 4, 2018

**Thoughts**: This is a bit of a challenge. but I got to learn ajax instead of JSON

### Day 4: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the weather app project

**Thoughts**: I'm now a bit more familiar with using APIs. I am a bit lazy doing the design for the project so I just made a simple design that looks okay.

### Day 5: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Done a few query and put in a template for FCC's wikipedia page

**Thoughts**: Didn't progress as much as I like because I was multitasking. Shouldn't do that next time. The time to do this increased to 2 hours and didn't finish :(

**Link to work**: None
